This website is meant to be a "mock directory" of all the resources students need to thrive at Pitt. There are a lot of websites and a lot of different resources, but because there isn't a single directory to streamline communication, a lot of students are unaware of all teh resources accessible to them at Pitt. By creating a single website that condenses academic, health and wellness, tech, and financial aid resources all in one place, I hope to present this mock website to student government so that more efforts can be made to streamline the communication of resources to the student body. The website is supposed to be simple, user-friendly, and Pitt-themed. I added buttons and point cursor functions to make the website more interactive and professional-looking.
