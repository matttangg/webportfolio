        <p>We're representatives from the College of General Studies Student Government (CGSSG) at Pitt, and we want to amplify student voices. Many students have told us that they feel frustrated with how many resources at Pitt are underutilized because of a communication gap between administration and students. We get it. There's just so many websites and emails, but these resources fall between the gaps without a streamlined system. We want to push for a comprehensive student resource directory at Pitt, and this website serves as an in-progress mock version that we will present to Pitt administration.  </p>
